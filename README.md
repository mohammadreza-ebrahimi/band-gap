## Two example for **LinearRegression** model in machine learning.

This repository is used for train a model in which we've  assumed that data follow a linear behavior. In machine learning, it is called **supervised learning**.

First example refers to the paper published in [Phys. Rev. B](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.93.115104):"_Prediction model of band gap for inorganic compounds by combination of
density functional theory calculations and machine learning techniques_". 
We have reviewed it and tried to predict the **band-gap** for almost 270 compounds measured by **G0W0** method. 

Another one, is about Feul Consumption that reported by Canada database. In this example, we predict **CO2 Emission** rate of each engine with respect to engine size. 
Again, we assumed it linearly depends.
